## Architecture

**Domain:** Multi-role olive oil sample evaluation and stock acquisition system for **Al Jazeera STCA** (Tunisia). UI in **French**. Production app â€” no prototype shortcuts.

**Five role modules under `lib/`:**

| Module | Role | French |
|--------|------|--------|
| `1_ceo/` | Direction/CEO | Directeur |
| `2_collecteur/` | Sample Collector | Collecteur |
| `3_degustateur/` | Taster | DÃ©gustateur |
| `4_laboratoire/` | Lab Technician | Technicien Labo |
| `5_chef_degustateur/` | Head Taster | Chef Dégustateur |

Al Jazeera STCA collects olive oil samples from suppliers across Tunisia, evaluates them, and purchases the best stocks to process and sell under their own brand. The collector travels the country registering samples on-site, sometimes offline. The taster physically receives samples at the company and runs sensory evaluations. The lab technician performs chemical analysis on those same received samples. The CEO oversees everything â€” reviewing evaluations, approving purchases, and tracking stock delivery â€” but never touches a sample directly.


Each module: `<role>/<feature>/models/`, `widgets/`, `services/`

**State management:** `StatefulWidget` + `setState()` only. No Provider/Riverpod/BLoC/GetX.  
**Navigation:** `Navigator.push()` / `pushReplacement()` + `MaterialPageRoute`. Each role uses a `Drawer`. No named routes.  
**Entry point:** `lib/main.dart` â€” global theme (green `#38835A`, Google Fonts Domine/Alegreya) + login with 4 debug buttons (**remove before production**).  
**Geospatial:** `GeoService` singleton at `lib/2_collecteur/carte_geo/services/geo_service.dart`, parses `assets/img/delegations.geojson` via `flutter_map`.  
**Data:** Real Django REST backend in `backend_new/`, reached through `lib/core/api_client.dart`.
`kApiBaseUrl` in `lib/config.dart` defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
Mock data is a **fallback, not the source**: `avecSecours()` in
`lib/core/services/resultat_service.dart` returns a hardcoded demo list when the HTTP call
fails, but only in debug builds (`if (kReleaseMode) rethrow`). In that state the UI shows the
`BandeauDemonstration` banner and **write actions are refused** with "Action indisponible avec
les données de démonstration". If buttons don't work, start the Django server — the mock is not
a switch.

## Sample States (overview)

**Collector-facing:** `RÃ©ceptionnÃ©` â†’ `RÃ©ceptionnÃ© (reÃ§u physiquement)` â†’ `En nÃ©gociation` â†’ `Achat confirmÃ©`  
**Lab-facing:** `En attente` â†’ `En cours` â†’ `Soumis`

## Design System

```dart
const Color _headerBg = Color.fromARGB(255, 220, 233, 226);
const Color _green    = Color(0xFF38835A);
const Color _dark     = Color(0xFF1A2E1F);
const Color _bg       = Color.fromARGB(255, 255, 255, 255);
const Color _white    = Color.fromARGB(255, 255, 255, 255);
```

**AppBar (mandatory for all pages):**
```dart
AppBar(
  backgroundColor: _headerBg,
  elevation: 0,
  centerTitle: false,
  toolbarHeight: 65,
  title: Text('Title', style: GoogleFonts.domine(fontSize: 18, fontWeight: FontWeight.w700, color: _dark)),
  iconTheme: const IconThemeData(color: _dark),
)
```

**Page body layout:**
1. Header zone â€” `Container(color: _headerBg)` with search + filter chips
2. Divider â€” `Container(height: 1, color: Colors.black.withValues(alpha: 0.06))`
3. Stats strip â€” `Container(color: _bg)` with count + clear-filter button
4. List â€” `Expanded` scrollable on white

**Filter chip colors:**
| State | Active | Inactive bg |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Tous | `0xFF616161` | `0xFFF0F0F0` |
| En attente / RÃ©ceptionnÃ© | `0xFF3A6EA5` | `0xFFE8F1FB` |
| En cours / En nÃ©gociation | `0xFFD07B2F` | `0xFFFEF3E8` |
| Soumis / Achat confirmÃ© | `0xFF38835A` | `0xFFE6F4ED` |

**FAB:** gray bg `Color.fromARGB(255, 197, 206, 201)`, dark icon + label.  
**Reference implementations:** `lib/1_ceo/echantillons/echantillons_ceo_page.dart` and `lib/3_degustateur/gestion_echantillons/gestion_echantillons_page.dart`

## Key Conventions

- All IDs are `String` (UUID), never `int`
- JSON keys must be `snake_case`
- All models implement `fromJson()` and `toJson()`
- All data access through a service class â€” never in widgets
- Auth tokens â†’ `flutter_secure_storage`, NOT `SharedPreferences`
- `baseUrl` only in `lib/config.dart`
- Linter allows `unused_local_variable`, `unused_import`, `unused_element`
- Assets declared in `pubspec.yaml` under `assets/img/`
- Always clarify which role module is being worked on before making changes
- The 4 debug login buttons in `main.dart` must be removed before production

## Two Hard Rules (stated by the project owner)

### 1. Same thing → same name, written the same way

If two variables, fields, classes or files serve the **same purpose in the same context**,
they get the **same name** and, where possible, live in **one shared file**. Do not rename
something just because it moved to another role module, and do not duplicate a file "for"
a second role when both use it identically.

Duplicated code drifts, and the drift is silent. This already caused a real bug: the
evaluation sample model was copied from `3_degustateur/` into `5_chef_degustateur/`, the
original was later taught to read lowercase statuses, and the copy never got the fix — so
every submitted evaluation displayed as "En attente" on the head taster's screen. Both
copies are now merged into [`lib/core/models/echantillon_evaluation.dart`](lib/core/models/echantillon_evaluation.dart).

**Before merging or renaming, verify two things:**
- it does not change **which table** a value is written to
- it does not cross **two users' data** (see rule 2)

Display-only code is safe to merge on sight. Anything on a write path gets checked first.
When the check passes, merge — no need to ask.

### 2. Never let one user's data reach or overwrite another's

Two failures to guard against:
- a **status belonging to user A shown to user B**
- **work done by user A overwritten by user B**

The consequence is operational, not cosmetic: someone stops seeing what they need, and the
work is delayed. With 5 roles evaluating the same samples in parallel, and traceability as
the whole point of the app, crossed user data corrupts the record of who did what.

Practical check: any code that groups records by sample id must not silently keep one
record per sample when several users each have their own. Verify the API already filters by
the connected user before assuming the client must.

## Backend Development Order

**Start with Sprint 1 — Collector module, NOT authentication.**
Authentication (JWT) is Sprint 2. The Collector is the entry point of the data pipeline.

See [`files/backend_sprint_plan.md`](files/backend_sprint_plan.md) for the full sprint order, models, endpoints, and permissions per sprint.
